  ABSTRACT = {Humans communicate using language, but they also communicate using gesture -- spontaneous movements of the hands and body that universally accompany speech. Gestures can be distinguished from other movements, segmented, and assigned meaning based on their forms and functions. Moreover, gestures systematically integrate with language at all levels of linguistic structure, as evidenced in both production and perception. Viewed typologically, gesture is universal, but nevertheless exhibits constrained variation across language communities (as does language itself). Finally, gesture has rich cognitive dimensions in addition to its communicative dimensions. In overviewing these and other topics, we show that the study of language is incomplete without the study of its communicative partner, gesture.},

  ABSTRACT = {50 undergraduates (aged 1850 yrs) participated in dyads or alone in experiments on interactive gestures (IAG) and topic gestures (TG). In Exp 1, a narrative task was assigned to both dyads and individuals: dyads had a higher rate of IAG than did individuals, but the opposite pattern was shown for TG. In Exp 2, visual availability was manipulated: the rate of IAG was higher for partners interacting face-to-face than for those who could not see each other, but TG were not significantly affected by condition. Thus, in both experiments, IAG and TG responded differently to social variables, which strongly suggests that they are functionally distinct groups. A final analysis showed that, in both data sets, IAG were less redundant with the words which they accompanied than were TG, which supports the hypothesis that they maintain involvement with the interlocutor without interrupting the verbal flow of discourse.

  ABSTRACT = {Speakers often gesture in telephone conversations, even though they are not visible to their addressees. To test whether this effect is due to being in a dialogue, we separated visibility and dialogue with three conditions: face-to-face dialogue (10 dyads), telephone dialogue (10 dyads), and monologue to a tape recorder (10 individuals). For the rate of gesturing, both dialogue and visibility had significant, independent effects, with the telephone condition consistently higher than the tape recorder. Also, as predicted, visibility alone significantly affected how speakers gestured: face-to-face speakers were more likely to make life-size gestures, to put information in their gestures that was not in their words, to make verbal reference to their gestures, and to use more gestures referring to the interaction itself. We speculate that demonstration, as a modality, may underlie these findings and may be intimately tied to dialogue while being suppressed in monologue.},

  ABSTRACT = {However one conceives of the relation between a sign and its significate, referring is a communicative act in which a speaker must intentionally direct the attention of an interlocutor to some object, event, or state of affairs that the speaker has in mind. This article examines the ontogenesis and phylogenesis of acts of referring, with special concern for the possible nature of sign-significate relationships. Findings from developments psychology indicate that a group of abilities and skills underlie the ability to refer. Infants follow the gaze of others to objects of attention, and enjoy joint attention with others. Interactions with caregivers in routines well known to the child enable her to achieve joint attention with the adult on a particular ingredient in the routine. In this way, the ability to refer develops from certain "language games" interactions that combine goal-seeking and joint attention.},

  ABSTRACT = {This article describes a previously undocumented deictic facial gesture of Papua New Guinea, which we call "nose-pointing". Based on a video corpus of examples produced by speakers of Yupno, an indigenous language of Papua New Guinea's Finisterre Range, we characterize the gesture's morphology -- which involves an effortful scrunching together of the face, or "S-action", in combination with a deictic head movement -- and illustrate its use in different interactive contexts. Yupno speakers produce the nose-pointing gesture in alternation with more familiar pointing morphologies, such as index finger and head-pointing, suggesting that the gesture carries a distinctive meaning. Interestingly, the facial morphological component of nose-pointing -- the S-action -- is also widely used non-deictically by Yupno speakers, and we propose that such uses provide crucial clues to the meaning of nose-pointing. We conclude by highlighting questions for further research, including precisely how nose-pointing relates to non-deictic uses of the S-action and what cultural and communicative pressures might have shaped the gesture.},

  ABSTRACT = {Language scientists have broadly addressed the problem of explaining how language users recognize the kind of speech act performed by a speaker uttering a sentence in a particular context. They have done so by investigating the role played by the illocutionary force indicating devices (IFIDs), i.e., all linguistic elements that indicate the illocutionary force of an utterance. The present work takes a first step in the direction of an experimental investigation of non-verbal IFIDs because it investigates the role played by facial expressions and, in particular, of upper-face action units (AUs) in the comprehension of three basic types of illocutionary force: assertions, questions, and orders. The results from a pilot experiment on production and two comprehension experiments showed that (1) certain upper-face AUs seem to constitute non-verbal signals that contribute to the understanding of the illocutionary force of questions and orders; (2) assertions are not expected to be marked by any upper-face AU; (3) some upper-face AUs can be associated, with different degrees of compatibility, with both questions and orders.},

  ABSTRACT =	 {In this paper we investigate the interaction between
                  verbal language and the non-verbal behaviours that
                  commonly accompany it. We focus on spontaneous hand
                  gestures. We discuss the complex network of
                  interactions between the two modalities and how we
                  can model the interpretation of a multichannel
                  signal. We embed this model of interpretation in the
                  LFG correspondence architecture and we show how the
                  flow of linguistic information that characterizes
                  the architecture can be used to make the
                  interpretation more precise. The result is an
                  enriched architecture in which a complex signal is
                  first broken up into its component parts. The
                  subcomponents are initially interpreted
                  independently but are then fused at the end into a
                  single meaning object. Our model can capture quite
                  precisely the intuitive meaning associated with
                  multimodal utterances.},

  ABSTRACT = {Facial expression and direction of gaze are two important sources of social information, and what message each conveys may ultimately depend on how the respective information interacts in the eye of the perceiver. Direct gaze signals an interaction with the observer but averted gaze amounts to "pointing with the eyes", and in combination with a fearful facial expression may signal the presence of environmental danger. We used fMRI to examine how gaze direction influences brain processing of facial expression of fear. The combination of fearful faces and averted gazes activated areas related to gaze shifting (STS, IPS) and fear-processing (amygdala, hypothalamus, pallidum). Additional modulation of activation was observed in motion detection areas, in premotor areas and in the somatosensory cortex, bilaterally. Our results indicate that the direction of gaze prompts a process whereby the brain combines the meaning of the facial expression with the information provided by gaze direction, and in the process computes the behavioral implications for the observer.},

  ABSTRACT = {The present study examined the neural correlates of speech and hand gesture comprehension in a naturalistic context. Fifteen participants watched audiovisual segments of speech and gesture while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to the speech. Gesture influenced the ERPs to the speech. Specifically, there was a right-lateralized N400 effect reflecting semantic integration when gestures mismatched versus matched the speech. In addition, early sensory components in bilateral occipital and frontal sites differentiated speech accompanied by matching versus non-matching gestures. These results suggest that hand gestures may be integrated with speech at early and late stages of language processing.},

  ABSTRACT = {We present a coding system combined with an annotation tool for the analysis of gestural behavior. The NEUROGES coding system consists of three modules that progress from gesture kinetics to gesture function. Grounded on empirical neuropsychological and psychological studies, the theoretical assumption behind NEUROGES is that its main kinetic and functional movement categories are differentially associated with specific cognitive, emotional, and interactive functions. ELAN is a free, multimodal annotation tool for digital audio and video media. It supports multileveled transcription and complies with such standards as XML and Unicode. ELAN allows gesture categories to be stored with associated vocabularies that are reusable by means of template files. The combination of the NEUROGES coding system and the annotation tool ELAN creates an effective tool for empirical research on gestural behavior.},

  ABSTRACT = {Current semantic theory on indexical expressions claims that demonstratively used indexicals such as this lack a referent-determining meaning but instead rely on an accompanying demonstration act like a pointing gesture. While this view allows to set up a sound logic of demonstratives, the direct-referential role assigned to pointing gestures has never been scrutinized thoroughly in semantics or pragmatics. We investigate the semantics and pragmatics of co-verbal pointing from a foundational perspective combining experiments, statistical investigation, computer simulation and theoretical modeling techniques in a novel manner. We evaluate various referential hypotheses with a corpus of object identification games set up in experiments in which body movement tracking techniques have been extensively used to generate precise pointing measurements. Statistical investigation and computer simulations show that especially distal areas in the pointing domain falsify the semantic direct-referential hypotheses concerning pointing gestures. As an alternative, we propose that reference involving pointing rests on a default inference which we specify using the empirical data. These results raise numerous problems for classical semantics-pragmatics interfaces: we argue for pre-semantic pragmatics in order to account for inferential reference in addition to classical post-semantic Gricean pragmatics.},

  ABSTRACT = {Despite its importance in the development of children's skills of social cognition and communication, very little is known about the ontogenetic origins of the pointing gesture. We report a training study in which mothers gave children one month of extra daily experience with pointing as compared with a control group who had extra experience with musical activities. One hundred and two infants of 9, 10, or 11 months of age were seen at the beginning, middle, and end of this one-month period and tested for declarative pointing and gaze following. Infants' ability to point with the index finger at the end of the study was not affected by the training but was instead predicted by infants' prior ability to follow the gaze direction of an adult. The frequency with which infants pointed indexically was also affected by infant gaze following ability and, in addition, by maternal pointing frequency in free play, but not by training. In contrast, infants' ability to monitor their partner's gaze when pointing, and the frequency with which they did so, was affected by both training and maternal pointing frequency in free play. These results suggest that prior social cognitive advances, rather than adult socialization of pointing per se, determine the developmental onset of indexical pointing, but socialization processes such as imitation and adult shaping subsequently affect both infants' ability to monitor their interlocutor's gaze while they point and how frequently infants choose to point.},

@ARTICLE{Schlenker:2018,
  ABSTRACT = {In dynamic theories of presupposition, a trigger pp' (e.g. it stopped raining) with presupposition p (it rained) and at-issue component p' (it doesn't now rain) comes with a requirement that p should be entailed by the local context of pp'. We argue that some co-speech gestures should be analyzed within a presuppositional framework, but with a twist: an expression p co-occurring with a co-speech gesture G with content g comes with the requirement that the local context of p should guarantee that p entails g; we call such assertion-dependent presuppositions `cosuppositions'. We show that this analysis can be combined with earlier theories of local contexts to account for complex patterns of gesture projection in quantified and in attitudinal contexts, and we compare our account to two potential alternatives: one based on supervaluations, and one, due to Cornelia Ebert, that treats co-speech gestures as supplements. We argue that the latter is correct, but for `post-speech' gestures (= gestures that come after the expressions they modify), rather than for co-speech gestures.},

  ABSTRACT = {This article presents a new computational model for the generation of multimodal referring expressions (REs), based on observations in human communication. The algorithm is an extension of the graph-based algorithm proposed by Krahmer, van Erk, and Verleg (2003) and makes use of a so-called Flashlight Model for pointing. The Flashlight Model accounts for various types of pointing gestures of different precisions. Based on a notion of effort, the algorithm produces REs combining language and pointing gestures. The algorithm is evaluated using two production experiments with which spontaneous data is gathered on controlled input. The output of the algorithm coincides to a large extent with the utterances of the participants. However, an important difference is that the participants tend to produce overspecified REs, whereas the algorithm generates minimal ones. This article briefly discusses ways to generate overspecified multimodal references.},

It reports on a computational experiment in which a group of distributed agents develop ways to identify each other using names or spatial descriptions. It is also shown that the proposed mechanism copes with the acquisition of an existing vocabulary by new agents entering the community and with an expansion of the set of meanings.},

  ABSTRACT = {Gestures and speech interact. They are linked in language production and perception, with their interaction contributing to felicitous communication. The multifaceted nature of these interactions has attracted considerable attention from the speech and gesture community. This article provides an overview of our current understanding of manual and head gesture form and function, of the principle functional interactions between gesture and speech aiding communication, transporting meaning and producing speech. Furthermore, we present an overview of research on temporal speech-gesture synchrony, including the special role of prosody in speech-gesture alignment. In addition, we provide a summary of tools and data available for gesture analysis, and describe speech-gesture interaction models and simulations in technical systems. This overview also serves as an introduction to a Special Issue covering a wide range of articles on these topics. We provide links to the Special Issue throughout this paper.},

@ARTICLE{Wu:Coulson:2005,
  ABSTRACT = {To assess semantic processing of iconic gestures, EEG (29 scalp sites) was recorded as adults watched cartoon segments paired with soundless videos of congruous and incongruous gestures followed by probe words. Event-related potentials time-locked to the onset of gestures and probe words were measured in two experiments. In Experiment 1, participants judged the congruency between gestures and cartoons. Gestures elicited an N400-like component (gesture N450) that was larger for incongruent than congruent items, as well as a late positivity that was larger for congruent items. In Experiment 2, participants assessed the relatedness between probe words and preceding cartoon-gesture pairs. N450 effects to gestures were observed without overlapping positivity. These findings suggest that iconic gestures are subject to semantic processes analogous to those evoked by other meaningful representations, such as pictures and words.},
