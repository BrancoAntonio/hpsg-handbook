% Comments from Gerald:

%I assume that the contributors would agree with me that this handbook is probably the wrong place to go into great technical detail on mathematical or computational subjects, but there needs to be at least something there to serve as a starting point from which the reader could choose to jump into some of the papers cited.â€Ž A summary of the major trends and the high-level intuitions behind a lot of the technical terminology that readers will encounter in HPSG-related CL papers, for example, would both be most welcome.

\section{Introduction}

% First draft: Emily

From the inception of HPSG in the 1980s,
there has been a close integration between theoretical and computational work
\crossrefchapterp[for an overview, see]{evolution}.
%\citep{FIXME-CLobit-or-other}.
% at HP Labs in the joint work of Ivan Sag, Geoff Pullum, Tom Wasow, Mark Gawron, Carl Pollard and Dan Flickinger
% GE: I think this list of authors is too long for a first sentence.  Do we need to do more than refer to the other chapter?
\citep{chapters/evolution}.
In this chapter, we discuss computational work in HPSG,
starting with the infrastructure that supports it (both theoretical and practical) in Section~\ref{cl:infrastructure}.
Next we describe several existing large-scale projects which build HPSG or HPSG-inspired grammars
(see Section~\ref{cl:resources})
and the deployment of such grammars in applications including both those within linguistic research and otherwise
(see Section~\ref{cl:deployment}).
Finally, we turn to linguistic insights gleaned from broad-coverage grammar development
(see Section~\ref{cl:insight}).

\subsection{Theoretical considerations}
\label{cl:theoretical}

There are several properties of HPSG as a theory that make it well-suited to computational implementation. First, the theory is kept separate from the formalism: the formalism is expressive enough to encode a wide variety of possible theories. While some theoretical work does argue for or against the necessity of particular formal devices (e.g.\ the shuffle operator \citep{FIXME-Reape}), much of it proceeds within shared assumptions about the formalism. This is in contrast to work in the context of the Minimalist Program \citep{Chomsky93b-u}, where theoretical results are typically couched in terms of modifications to the formalism itself. From a computational point of view, the benefit of differentiating between theory and formalism is that it means that the formalism is relatively stable. That in turns enables the development and maintenance of software systems that target the formalism, for parsing, generation, and grammar exploration (see Section~\ref{cl:history} below for some examples).\footnote{There are implementations of Minimalism, notably \citet{FIXME-Stabler} and \citet{FIXME-Indianadiss}. However, writing an implementation requires fixing the formalism, and so these are unlikely to be useful for testing theoretical ideas as the theory moves on.}

A second important property of HPSG that supports a strong connection between theoretical and computational work is an interest in both so-called `core' and so-called `peripheral' phenomena. Most implemented grammars are built with the goal of handling naturally occurring text.\footnote{Though it is possible to do implementation work strictly against testsuites of sentences constructed specifically to focus on phenomena of interest.} This means that they will need to handle a wide variety of linguistic phenomena not always treated in theoretical syntactic work \citep{FIXME-Baldwin-et-al-Beauty}. A syntactic framework that excludes research on `peripheral' phenomena as uninteresting provides less support for implementational work than does one, like HPSG or Construction Grammar \citep{FIXME}, that values such topics.

Finally, the type hierarchy characteristic of HPSG lends itself well to developing broad-coverage grammars which are maintainable over time \citep{FIXME-find-cite?}. The use of the type hierarchy to manage complexity at scale comes out of the work of \citet{Flickinger87} and others at HP labs in the project where HPSG was originally developed. The core idea is that any given constraint is (ideally) expressed only once on types which serve as supertypes to all entities that bear that constraint.\footnote{Originally this only applied to lexical entries in Flickinger's work. Now it also applies phrase structure rules, lexical rules, and types below the level of the sign which are used in the definition of all of these.} Such constraints might represent broad generalizations that apply to many entities or relatively narrow, indiosyncratic properties. By isolating any given constraint on one type (as opposed to repeating it in mutiple places), we build grammars that are easier to update and adapt in light of new data that require refinements to constraints. Having a single locus for each constraint also makes the types a very useful target for documentation \citep{FIXME:LTDB} and grammar exploration \citep{FIXME:typediff}. 


\subsection{Practical considerations}
\label{cl:prac}

The formalism of HPSG allows practical implementations,
since feature structures are well-defined data structures.
Furthermore, because HPSG is defined to be bi-directional,
an implemented grammar can be used for both parsing and generation.
In this section, we discuss how HPSG allows tractable algorithms,
which enables HPSG grammars to be used in a range of NLP applications,
as we will see in Section~\ref{cl:deployment}.

\subsubsection{Computational complexity}
\label{cl:prac:comp}

One way to measure how easy or difficult it is to use a syntactic theory
is to consider the \textit{computational complexity} of parsing and generation algorithms.
For example, we can consider how much computational time
a parsing algorithm needs to process a particular sentence.
For longer sentences, we would expect the amount of time to increase,
but the more complex the algorithm is,
the more quickly the amount of time increases.
If we consider sentences containing $n$~tokens,
we can find the average amount of time taken,
or the longest amount of time taken.
We can then increase~$n$, and see how the amount of time changes,
both in the average case, and in the worst case.

At first sight, analysing computational complexity
would seem to paint HPSG in a bad light,
because the formalism allows us to write grammars
which can be arbitrarily complex;
this means that the formalism can be called \textit{Turing-complete}
\citep[Section~3.4]{Johnson88}.
However, as discussed in the previous section,
there is a clear distinction between theory and formalism.
Although the feature-structure formalism rules out the possibility of efficient algorithms
that could cope with any possible feature-structure grammar,
a particular theory (or a particular grammar) might well allow efficient algorithms.

The difference between theory and formalism
becomes clear when comparing HPSG to other computationally-friendly frameworks,
such as Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG),\footnote{%
	For an introduction, see \citet{steedman2011ccg}.
	For a comparison with HPSG, see \crossrefchaptert{cg}.
}
or Tree Adjoining Grammar \citep[TAG;][]{Joshi87a-u,SAJ88a-u}).
The formalisms of CCG and TAG inherently limit computational complexity:
for both of them, as the sentence length~$n$ increases,
worst-case parsing time is proportional to~$n^6$ \citep{Kasamietal1989}.
This is a deliberate feature of these formalisms,
which aim to be just expressive enough to capture human language,
and not any more expressive.
Building this kind of constraint into the formalism itself
highlights a different school of thought from HPSG.
Indeed, \citet{MuellerCoreGram} explicitly argues
in favour of developing linguistic analyses first,
and improving processing efficiency second.
As discussed above in Section~\ref{cl:theoretical},
separating the formalism from the theory
means that the formalism is stable, even as the theory develops.

It would beyond the scope of this chapter
to give a full review of parsing algorithms,
but it is instructive to give an example.
For grammars that have a context-free backbone
(we can express every derivation as a phrase-structure tree
plus constraints between mother and daughter nodes),
it is possible to adapt the standard chart-parsing algorithm for context-free grammars.
The basic idea is to parse ``bottom-up'' through the tree,
starting by finding analyses for each token in the input,
and then finding analyses for increasingly longer sequences of tokens,
until we reach the entire sentence.
The resulting algorithm is more computationally complex than for a context-free grammar,
because we are dealing with feature structures, rather than nonterminal symbols.
While a context-free grammar allows a finite number of nonterminals,
a feature-structure grammar may allow a infinite number of possible feature structures.
For an HPSG grammar without recursive unary rules,
this algorithm has a worst-case complexity of exponential time.
This is less complex than for an arbitrary grammar
(which means that this class of grammars is \textit{not} Turing-complete),
but more complex than for CCG or TAG.
However, when parsing real corpora,
it turns out that the average-case complexity is much better than we might expect.
On the one hand, grammatical constructions do not generally combine in the worst-case way,
and on the other hand, when there are multiple possible analyses for a particular construction,
a grammar writer may end up choosing the analysis that is more efficient for a particular parsing algorithm.

\subsubsection{Parse ranking}
\label{cl:prac:rank}

% GE: not sure if this should be here or go in a later section

For an ambiguous sentence,
a grammar gives multiple valid parses.
This is widely known, with attachment ambiguities and coordination ambiguities
being particularly well-known examples.
However, people are naturally very good at resolving ambiguity,
which means most ambiguity is not apparent, even to linguists.
It is only with the development of large-scale grammars that the sheer scale of ambiguity has become clear.
For example, \rref{cl:ex:ambig-simple}~might seem unambiguous,
but there is a second reading, where \textit{my favourite} is the topicalized object of \textit{speak},
which would mean that town criers generally speak the speaker's favourite thing (perhaps a language) clearly.
There a third, even more implausible reading, where \textit{my favourite town} is the topicalized object.
Such implausible readings don't easily come to mind,
but with increasingly long sentences, such ambiguities stack up very quickly.
For~\rref{cl:ex:ambig-many}, the first line of a newspaper article,\footnote{%
	\url{https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/22/offspring-of-neanderthal-and-denisovan-identified-for-first-time}
}
the 1214 version of the English Resource Grammar \citep{Flickinger2000a,Flickinger2011a-u}
gives TODO readings.
\begin{exe}
\ex\label{cl:ex:ambig-simple}
My favourite town criers speak clearly.
\ex\label{cl:ex:ambig-many}
A small piece of bone found in a cave in Siberia has been identified as the remnant of a child whose mother was a Neanderthal and father was a Denisovan, a mysterious human ancestor that lived in the region.
\end{exe}

In practical applications, considering all possible parses can be infeasible,
and we may want to automatically disambiguate each sentence.
This can be done by \textit{ranking} the parses,
so that the application only uses the most highly-ranked parse,
or the top~$N$ parses.
Parse ranking is not usually determined by the grammar itself,
because of the difficulty of manually writing disambiguation rules.
Typically, a statistical system is used \citep{OFTM2004a-u-platte}.
First, a corpus is \textit{treebanked}:
for each sentence in the corpus,
an annotator (often the grammar writer) chooses the best parse,
out of all parses produced by the grammar.
The set of all parses for a sentence is often referred to as the \textit{parse forest},
and the selected best parse is often referred to as the \textit{gold standard}.
Given the gold parses for the whole corpus, a statistical system is trained
to predict the gold parse from a parse forest,
based on many features\footnote{%
	In the machine learning sense of ``feature'',
	not the feature-structure sense.
}
of the parse.
From the example in~\rref{cl:ex:ambig-simple},
we can see how a number of a different features all influence the preferred interpretation:
the likelihood of a construction (such as topicalization),
the likelihood of a valence frame (such as transitive \textit{speak}),
the likelihood of a collocation (such as \textit{town crier}),
the likelihood of a semantic relation (such as speaking a town),
and so on.

%TODO references...

Because of the large number of possible parses,
it can be helpful to \textit{prune} the search space:
rather than ranking the full set of parses,
we can restrict attention to a smaller set of parses,
which hopefully includes the correct parse.
By carefully choosing how to restrict our attention,
we can drastically reduce processing time without hurting performance.

\subsubsection{Semantic dependencies}
\label{cl:prac:dep}

In practical applications of HPSG grammars,
the full derivation trees and the full feature structures are often seen as unwieldy,
containing far more information than necessary for the task at hand.
It is often desirable to extract a concise semantic representation.
