% Comments from Gerald:

%I assume that the contributors would agree with me that this handbook is probably the wrong place to go into great technical detail on mathematical or computational subjects, but there needs to be at least something there to serve as a starting point from which the reader could choose to jump into some of the papers cited.‎ A summary of the major trends and the high-level intuitions behind a lot of the technical terminology that readers will encounter in HPSG-related CL papers, for example, would both be most welcome.

\section{Introduction}

% First draft: Emily

From the inception of HPSG in the joint work of Ivan Sag, Geoff Pullum, Tom Wasow, Mark Gawron, Carl Pollard and Dan Flickinger at HP Labs in the 1980s \cite{FIXME-CLobit-or-other}, there has been a close integration between theoretical and computational work. In this chapter, we give an overview of computational work in HPSG, starting with the infrastructure that supports it (both theoretical and practical) in \S\ref{sec:infrastructure}. Next we describe several existing large-scale projects which build HPSG or HPSG-inspired grammars (\S\ref{sec:resources}) and the deployment of such grammars in applications including both those within linguistic research and otherwise (\S\ref{sec:deployment}).  Finally, we turn to lessons for linguistics gleaned from broad-coverage grammar gdevelopment.

% EMB 2018-07-26 That seems like a relatively weak intro, but putting it in as aplace-holder for now.
