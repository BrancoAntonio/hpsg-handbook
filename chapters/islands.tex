\abstract{
Extraction constraints on long-distance dependencies  -- so-called \emph{islands} --  have been  the  subject of intense linguistic and psycholinguistic research for the last half century, ever since the seminal work of \citet{Ross67}.   Despite  of  their importance in syntactic theory, the   heterogeneity of island constraints has posed many difficult challenges to linguistic theories, not just HPSG. Island phenomena are unlikely  to be due to a unitary syntactic
constraint given the fact that virtually all such island constraints have known exceptions.  Rather, it is more likely that island constraints  result from a combination of independently motivated syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and processing phenomena.}

\section{Introduction} 

 This chapter provides an overview of various island effects that have received attention from members of
 the HPSG community. I begin with the extraction constraints peculiar to coordinate structures, which not only have a special status in the history of HPSG but also because they
illustrate well the non-unitary nature of island constraints. I then argue that, at a deeper level, some of these constraints are in fact present in many other island types, though not necessarily all.
For example,
I take it as relatively clear that factive islands  are purely pragmatic in nature \citep{Oshima:2006:FIP:1761528.1761544}, as are negative islands \citep{abrusan,abrusanspec},
although one can quibble about the particular technical details of how such accounts are best articulated. 
Similarly,  the NP Constraint is likely to be at least semantic in nature \citep{kuno87,godard92,dubinsky2009}, though more cognitive factors probably play a role there as well \citep{Dean}. Conversely, I take it as relatively uncontroversial that the Clause Non-Final Incomplete Constituent  Constraint  is essentially due to processing  \citep{lev91,fodor92}, given how weak it is, and how abundant its counterexamples. In the present chapter I focus on islands that have garnered more attention from members of the HPSG community, and that have caused more 
 controversy cross-theoretically.

\section{The Coordinate Structure Constraint}

\cite{Ross67} first observed that coordinate structures
impose various constraints on long-distance dependencies, shown in  (\ref{bors}), collectively dubbed the
\emph{Coordinate Structure Constraint}. For perspicuity,  I  follow \citet{grosu73} in referring to (i) as the \emph{Conjunct Constraint} and to (ii) as the \emph{Element Constraint}.

\ea 
\textsc{Coordinate Structure Constraint} (CSC):

In a coordinate structure, (i) no conjunct may be moved,
(ii) nor may any element contained in a conjunct be moved out
of that conjunct
\ldots unless each conjunct properly contains a gap paired with the same filler.
\z \label{bors}

\noindent
The \emph{Conjunct Constraint} (CC) is illustrated by the unacceptability of the extractions in (\ref{cc}). No such constraint is active in other constructions like those in (\ref{com}) and (\ref{compar0}), for example.

\item Which celebrity you say Robin arrived earlier than \spc?
\z \label{compar0}
\z

\noindent
In HPSG accounts that use traces \citep{pollardsag,levhubook} the CC must be stipulated at the level of the coordination construction, by stating that conjuncts cannot be traces. On the other hand, the CC  follows immediately in a traceless account of  filler-gap dependencies  \citep{fodorsagt,bouma,ginzsag,fgsag08} since there is simply nothing to conjoin in (\ref{cc}), and thus nothing else needs to be said about conjunct extraction; see \citet{sagonline} for more criticism of  traces. 

HPSG's traceless account of the CC is ultimately semantic in nature.  Coordinators like \emph{and}, \emph{or}, \emph{but} and so on are not regarded as heads that select arguments, and therefore
have empty {\sc arg-st} and valence specifications. And given that HPSG assumes that
the signs that can appear  in a given lexical head {\sc slash} values are valents, then
it follows that the signs that coordinators combine with cannot instead be registered
in the coordinator's {\sc slash} feature. Hence, words like \emph{and} have no valents, no arguments
and therefore no conjunct extraction. See \crossrefchaptert{udc} and \crossrefchaptert{coordination} for more discussion on extraction and coordination.
 
Let us now turn to the \emph{Element Constraint},  illustrated in (\ref{cc2}). As before, the constraint appears to be restricted to coordination structures, as no  oddness arises in the comitative counterparts like  (\ref{cc3}), or in comparatives like (\ref{compar}).\footnote{Although \citet[83]{winter01} and others claim that coordination imposes semantic scope islands, \citet[3.6]{chavesthesis} shows that this is not the case, as illustrated in examples like those below.

The ATB exception to the CSC is illustrated by the acceptability of (\ref{cc4}), where each conjunct hosts a gap, linked to the same filler. Multiple gaps can be linked to the same filler in other constructions besides  coordination, as  (\ref{cc5}) illustrates.

\citet{gazdar} and \citet{gpsg} assumed that the coordination rule  requires {\sc slash} values to be structure-shared across conjuncts and the mother node, thus  predicting  both the Element Constraint and the ATB exceptions. A similar constraint is assumed in \citet[202]{pollardsag}
\citet[60]{Beavers}, among many others, as illustrated in (\ref{cschpsgr}). see \crossrefchaptert{udc} for more discussion about extraction and \crossrefchaptert{coordination} for more discussion about coordination. 

\ea
{\sc Coordination Construction} (abbreviated)

\begin{avm}
{\footnotesize $coordinate$-$phr$} $\Rightarrow$ \[synsem \| nonlocal \| slash \@{1}\\
                                                             dtrs \<  \[synsem \| nonlocal \| slash & \@{1} \], \\ 
                                                                              \[synsem \| nonlocal \| slash & \@{1} \] \>\]
\end{avm}
\z \label{cschpsgr}

\noindent
Because   the {\sc slash} value \avmbox{1} is structure-shared between the mother and the daughters
in (\ref{cschpsgr}), then all  three nodes must bear the same {\sc slash} value.  This predicts the CSC and the ATB exceptions  straightforwardly. The failure of mainstream Chomskyan  grammar to predict these and related multiple  gap extraction facts in a precise way is regarded as one of the  major empirical advantages of HPSG  over movement-based accounts.

  However,  the facts about extraction in coordination structures are more complex than originally assumed, and than (\ref{cschpsgr}) allows for. A crucial  difference between the Conjunct Constraint and the Element Constraint is  that the latter is only in effect if the coordination has a symmetric interpretation  \citep{Ross67,goldsmith,lakoff86,levinprince86}, as in  (\ref{asym}).\footnote{In symmetric coordination the order of the conjunct has a reflection on the semantic interpretation.
  Thus, \emph{Robin jumped on a horse and rode into the sunset} does not 
mean the same as  \emph{Robin rode into the sunset and jumped on a horse}. Conversely,
in symmetric coordination the order of the conjuncts has no interpretational  differences,
as illustrated by the paraphrases \emph{Robin drank a beer and Sue ate a burger}
and \emph{Sue ate a burger and Robin drank a beer}.}

 Here's the whiskey  which I [[went to the store] and [bought \spc]].

\item How much can you [[drink \spc] and [still stay sober]]?
\z \label{asym}
\z

% OR

\noindent
To be sure, the coordinate status of (\ref{asym}) has been questioned since \cite{Ross67}. After all, if these are subordinate structures rather than coordinate structures then the possibility for non-ATB long-distance dependencies ceases to be exceptional. But as 
\citet{schmerling72},  \citet{lakoff86}, \citet{levinepostal} and \citet[cf.]{kehler}  point out,  there is no empirical reason to assume that (\ref{asym}) are anything other than coordination structures. 

Another reason to reject the idea that  the {\sc slash} values of the daughters and the mother node are are simply equated in ATB extraction is the fact that sometimes multiple gaps are `cumulatively' combined into a `pluralic gap'.\footnote{See for example  \citet{munn98atb,munn99atb},  \citet[136,160]{postal98},
    \citet[125]{kehler},
 \citet{gawronkehlersalt}, 
 \citet{zhang}, \citet{chavessubjexp}, and \citet{Vicente2016-NELS46}.}
As an example, consider the extractions in (\ref{cumulative}). There are two possible interpretations
for such extractions: one in the \emph{ex situ} signs (i.e.\ the gap signs) and the filler phrase are co-indexed, and therefore co-referential, and a second reading in which the two \emph{ex situ} signs are no not co-indexed even though they are linked to the same filler phrase.  Rather, the filler phrase refers to a plural
 referent composed by the referents of the \emph{ex situ} signs, as indicated by the subscripts 
in (\ref{cumulative}). For different speakers, the preferred reading is the former, and in other cases,
the latter, often depending on the example.

%(possible answer: `The train line ran from NYC to Montreal')

In conclusion, the  non-ATB exceptions in (\ref{asym}) suggest that the coordination rule should not constrain {\sc slash} at all, an approach that is explicitly discussed in \citep[203]{pollardsag} and
argued for in more detail in \citet{chaves}.  Rather,  the Element Constraint, its ATB exceptions in (\ref{cc4}a,b), and the asymmetric non-ATB exceptions in (\ref{asym}) are more likely to be the consequence of a independent semantic-pragmatic constraint that requires the filler phrase to be `topical'  relative to the clause \citep{lakoff86,kuno87,kehler,kubotalee}. Thus, if the coordination is  symmetric, then the topicality requirement  distributes over each conjunct, to require that the  filler phrase be topical in each conjunct. Consequently, extraction must
be ATB in symmetric coordination. No distribution is need take place in asymmetric coordination, and thus both 
ATB and non-ATB extraction is licit in asymmetric coordination. For an attempt to transfer
some of Kuno's and Kehlers' insights in to HPSG  see \citet{chaves}. In the latter proposal,
 the coordination rule is like most other rules in the grammar in that it says nothing about
the {\sc slash} values of the mother and the daughters, along the lines of 
\citet[354]{levhubook}. In other words, the constraints on {\sc slash} in (\ref{cschpsgr}) are unnecessary.  Rather, pragmatics is the driving force behind how  long-distance dependencies propagate one or more conjuncts, depending on the coordination being interpreted symmetrically or not. 
See \crossrefchaptert{coordination} for more discussion.

In sum, the CSC does not receive a unitary account in modern HPSG, as the Conjunct Constraint and the Element Constraint  are due to  very different factors. Whereas the former does not admit ATB extraction, and is predicted by a traceless analysis, the latter allows ATB extraction as seen by the contrast between  (\ref{cc}c) and  (\ref{cc4}a,b). 
Upon closer inspection, the Element Constraint and the ATB exceptions are semantic-pragmatic in nature.  As we shall see, a similar conclusion is plausible for various other island phenomena.


\section{Complex NP Constraint}

The Complex NP Constraint concerns the difficulty in extracting out of complex NPs formed with either relative clauses (\ref{cpnpb}) or complementizer phrases (\ref{cpnpb2}).

\ea \label{cpnpb}
\ea *[What]$_i$ does Robin know $[$someone who has \spc$_i]$?\\
(cf.\ with `Does Robin know someone who has a drum kit?')
\item *[Which language]$_i$ did they hire [someone [who speaks \spc$_i$]]?\\
(cf.\ with `Did they hire someone who speaks Arabic?')
\z
\z

\ea 
 \ea *[Which book]$_i$ do you believe the claim [that Robin plagiarized  \spc$_i$]?\\
(cf.\ with `Do you believe the claim that Robin plagiarized  \emph{this book}?')
\item *What$_i$  did you believe [the rumor [that Ed disclosed \spc$_i$]]?\\
(cf.\ with `Did you believe [the rumor [that Ed disclosed \emph{that}]]?')
\z \label{cpnpb2}
\z 

\noindent
It is tempting to  prevent extractions out of adnominal clauses by simply stipulating  that the {\sc slash} value of the modifier must be empty, as (\ref{relcx}) illustrates.
 Perhaps, along the lines of \citet{fodor78,Fodor83}, \citet{berwickwein}, and \citet{hawkins,hawbook}, 
 processing difficulties  lead to the grammaticization of such a constraint, effectively
  blocking any modified head from hosting any gaps.

                                                             head-dtr  \@{1}\\

\end{avm}
\z \label{relcx}


However, the robustness of the CNPC  has been challenged by various
counterexamples over the years \citep{Ross67,pollardsag,kluender,postal98,saghof}.
The sample in (\ref{csubok}) involves acceptable
extractions from NP-embedded complement CPs (some of which definite),
 and (\ref{csubok2}) involves acceptable extractions from NP-embedded relative clauses.\footnote{Counterexamples to  the CNPC can be found in a number of languages, 
including Japanese and  Korean \citep{kunojap,Nishigauchi99},  Ahan \citep{saah},  Danish  \citep[ch.2]{shir}, Swedish  \citep{allwood,engdahl82} Norwegian  Engdahl 1980 \citep{taraldsen82} and Romance languages \citep{Cinque10}.  In some languages that support verb constructions the CNPC is 
 not active, which goes with the analysis as complex predicates (REFS).}
 \marginpar{\tiny Refs missing.}

%Cases like ROSS have been taken to be lexically conditioned and  treated in terms of complex-predicate formation /N-V reanalysis/N-incorporation (Chomsky 1980, Kayne 1981, Cinque 1990, Davies and Dubinsky 2003).

\citep{chungmc}

(Kluender, 1992, 238)

\item Which diamond ring did you say there was [nobody in the world [who could

\citep[206]{pollardsag}

\item John is the sort of guy that I don't know [a lot of people [who think well of
\spc$_i$]].\\
\citep[230]{culicover99}
\z \label{rel}
\z

In the above counterexamples the relative clauses contribute to the main assertion of the utterance, rather than expressing background information. For example, (\ref{rel}a) asserts `There are many people who like this kind of weather' rather than `This the kind of weather', and so on.
Some authors have argued that it is precisely because such relatives
express new information that the extraction can escape the embedded clause
  \citep{shirlappin,kuno87,Dean,goldberg13}.  If this is correct, then the proper 
  account of CNPC effects is not unlike that of the CSC. In both cases, 
  the information structural status of the clause that contains the gap is crucial
  to the acceptability of the overall long-distance dependencies.\footnote{Although it is sometimes claimed
   that
such  island effects are also active in logical form and semantic scope \citep{may85,ruys,fox,sab,katzira}, 
  there much reason to be skeptical.  For example, the universally quantified noun phrase  in (i)  is embedded in a relative clause can have wide scope over the indefinite \emph{someone}, constituting a semantic CNPC violation. Note that these relatives are not presentational, and therefore are not specially permeable to extraction.

In addition to pragmatic constraints,  \citet{kluender92,kluender} also proposed that 
processing factors also  influence the acceptability of    CNPC violations.
Consider for example the acceptability hierarchy in  (\ref{k}),  more specific filler phrases increase acceptability whereas    the presence of more specific phrases between the filler and the gap seem  to cause increased processing difficulty, and therefore   lower the acceptability of the sentence.  The symbol `$<$' reads as `is less acceptable than'.

\indent
There is on-line sentence processing evidence that   CNPC   violations  with more informative  fillers are more acceptable and are processed faster at the gap site than violations with less informative fillers \citep{hofsaglang}, as in  (\ref{dd4}).

\noindent
Finally, given that  finite tensed verbs can be regarded as definite, and infinitival verbs as indefinite,
 following \citet{partee84}, and given that finiteness can create processing difficulty 
 \citep{kluender92,gibson0000}, then acceptability clines like 
(\ref{fininf}) are to be expected. See \citet[ch.5]{levhubook} and \citet[308]{levine17} for more discussion.

The amelioration caused by definite \emph{wh}-phrases as in  (\ref{k}d), (\ref{ddf}b) and (\ref{fininf}c) 
has been called a `D-Linking' effect  \citep{pesetskydlink,pesetskybook}, which purportedly arises if the set of possible answers is pre-established or otherwise salient. But there are several problems with the D-Linking story.   First, there is currently no non-circular definition of D-Linking; see 
\citet[16]{pesetskybook},
 \citet[247--250]{ginzsag}, 
 \citet[33, 39]{chung94},
\citet[242, 268--271]{levhubook}. Second, the counterexamples above are given out-of-the-blue, and therefore cannot evoke any preexisting set of referents, as D-Linking 
requires.   Furthermore, nothing should prevent D-Linking with a bare \emph{wh}-item, as Pesetsky himself acknowledges, but on the other hand there is no experimental evidence that context can lead to D-linking of a bare \emph{wh}-phrase \citep{sprousediss07,villata}.\footnote{For more detailed criticism of D-Linking see \citet{hof2007}.}

 \citet{kroch89} and \citet[270]{levhubook} point out that `'D-Linking' amelioration effects  may simply depend on the plausibility of background assumptions associated with the proposition in question. In addition, as \citet{kluenderkustas}, \citet{saghof}, \citet{philcls}, \citet{philipt07} and \citet{hofsaglang} not,  more definite \emph{wh}-phrases improve the  acceptability of  extractions because they resist memory decay better than indefinites, and compatible with fewer potential gap sites. 

 
  \citet{sprouse12} use $n$-back and serial recall tasks to argue that there is no evidence that working
  memory limitations correlate with island acceptability, and therefore that the `processing-based'
  account of islands put forth by  \citet{kluender92,kluender}, \citet{kluenderkustas}, \citep{hofsaglang} and others is unfounded. To be sure, it cannot be stressed enough that the accounts in \citet{kluender92} and \citep{hofsaglang} are  not strictly based on performance, and involve other factors as well, most notably pragmatic factors. See in particular \citet[49]{hoflangreply}, where it is argued that at least some extraction constraints may be due to a combination of syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and performance factors.  Basically, if the correct location of a gap is syntactically, semantically, or pragmatically highly unlikely in that particular utterance, then it is less likely for the sentence to be acceptable.  Indeed, there is independent experimental evidence that  speakers attend to  probabilistic information about the syntactic distribution of  filler-gap dependencies \citep{culcogsci},  and that gap  predictability  is crucial for on-line processing of islands \citep{michelt}.\footnote{More broadly, there is good  evidence that  speakers deploy probabilistic information when  processing a variety of linguistic input, including words \citep{altman99,arai,creel,delong,kutas84},  lexical categories \citep{gibson07,levy13,tabor97},  syntactic structures \citep{levyted,lau06,levy08,staub},  semantics \citep{altman99,federmeier,kamide03}, and pragmatics \citep{shankweiler,mak,roland12}.} But as \citet{reply2} point out, there is no reason to believe  that $n$-back and serial recall tasks are strongly correlated to working memory capacity to begin with. Second, one of the main points of \citep{hofsaglang} is that the literature  on experimental  island research has not systematically controlled for multiple factors that can impact the processing and comprehension of complex sentences. If the experimental items are excessively  complex, then readers are less likely to give up understanding the utterances and subtler effects  will not be measurable.  \citet{phil13}, however, regard such concerns as irrelevant.
  
  Although it is unclear to what extent expectations contribute to island effects, in particular expectations sensitive to the semantics and pragmatics of the utterance, it is likely that they play a significant role in CNPC effects and in various other island types discussed below.


\section{Right Roof Constraint}

Rightward movement is traditionally regarded as being clause bounded, as per the 
the \emph{Right Roof Constraint}  \citep{Ross67} effects  illustrated in (\ref{rrc}). 
 In such constructions, a phrase appears \emph{ex situ} in a position 
to the right of its \emph{in situ} counterpart; see   \citet{akma75}, \citet{baltin78}, and  \citet{stowelldiss}, among others.

\noindent
When treated as a form of extraction, rightward movement has been predominantly
accounted for via a feature {\sc extra(posed)} \citep{Noord:Bouma:96,eynde96,
kellerverb,KimSag2005}, rather than by {\sc slash}.  
Thus, RRC island effects in can be easily modeled by stipulating that the  {\sc extra} value of an S node must be empty. One way to do so
is to state that any S valent must be [{\sc extra} $\lbrace \rbrace$].
Thus, no extraposed element may escape its clause. However,  the oddness of (\ref{rrc}) may not be due any such syntactic stipulation, given the acceptability of counterexamples like (\ref{longb}). Note that the adverbial interveners in such examples do not  require parenthetical prosody. Conversely, even strong  parenthetical
prosody on the adverbs in (\ref{rrc}) fails to improve those data.

\noindent
The  durative semantics  of   \emph{I've been wanting/requesting/wondering} 
 raises an expectation about the realization of   a durative  
adverbial expression like  \emph{ever since} or \emph{for many years} that
provides information about the durative semantics of the main predicate.
Hence, the adverb is cued by the main predication, in some sense, and 
  coheres much better in a high attachment than with a lower one.

The fact that the RRC is prone to exceptions has been noted by multiple authors as the sample in 
 (\ref{unb}) illustrates. In all such cases, a phrase is right-extracted
 from an embedded clause, which should be flat out impossible if extraposition is clause-bounded. Again, the adverbial  interveners in (\ref{unb}) do not require any special prosody, which means that
  these data cannot be easily discarded as parenthetical insertions.

Further evidence against a syntactic account of RRC comes from  corpora and experimental findings by  \citet{strunk08,strunk}, which confirms that  extraposition does  not always obey  island constraints.  The counterexamples in (\ref{nosubza}a--c) are adapted from
 \citet{strunk08} and \citet{strunk}, and those in (\ref{nosubza}d--f) are from \citet[863]{chavesrnr}.

 \citet{grosurrc},  \citet{gazdar} and \citet{stucky} argued that the RRC is the result of
  performance  factors such as  syntactic and semantic parsing expectations and  memory resource  limitations,  not grammar proper.   Indeed, we now know that  there is a general well-known  tendency for the language processor to  prefer attaching new material
 to the more recent constituents  \citep{frazcl,gibetal,trax98,fodor02b,fernandez03}. 
Indeed, eye-tracking studies like \citet{hnps}  indicate that the
parser is reluctant to adopt  extraposition  parses.
This  explains why     extraposition in written texts
is less common in proportion to length of  the  intervening material \citep{UBDKKOS98b}:
the longer the structure, the bigger the processing burden. 
 Crucially, however, the preference for the closest attachment can be weakened by
many factors \citep{fernandez03,desmet,devic,carreras}. 
For example,  \citet{levyted}  show that relative clause extraposition creates
 significant processing difficulty when compared with  non-extraposed counterparts of 
 the same sentences,   but that a preceding context that sets up a strong expectation
for a relative clause modifying a given noun can  facilitate
comprehension of an extraposed relative clause modifying that noun.
In other words, in spite of a larger processing burden,
some extrapositions can be made easier to process by parsing expectations.
Thus we get contrasts like (\ref{doubleex}).

A detailed account of such island phenomena and their exceptions does not exist in any framework, as far as I
am aware. But the line of inquiry first proposed by  \citet{grosurrc},  \citet{gazdar} and \citet{stucky},  and later experimentally supported by \citet{levyted}, \citet{strunk08}, and \citet{strunk} seems to be in the right track. If so, then there is no syntactic constraint on {\sc extra}. Rather, RCC effects are to a large extent the result of difficulty in integrating the extraposed phrase in its  \emph{in situ} position.  

A related island phenomenon also involving rightward displacement, first noted in \citet[305]{Ross67},
is \emph{Freezing}: leftward extraction (\ref{z1}a) and extraposition (\ref{z1}b) cause low acceptability when they interact, as seen in (\ref{f}). In (\ref{f}a) there is extraction from an extraposed PP,  in (\ref{f}b)  there is extraction from an extraposed NP,  and  in (\ref{f}c) an extraction from a PP crossed with direct object extraposition.

  \citet[457]{fodor78} notes that (\ref{f}c) has a syntactically highly probable temporary alternative parse  in which \emph{to} combines with the NP \emph{a picture of my brother}. The existence of this local ambiguity  likely disrupts  parsing, especially as it occurs in a portion of the sentence that contains two gaps in close succession. Indeed, constructions with two independent gaps in close proximity  are licit, but not trivial to process, as seen in (\ref{ddg}), specially if the  extraction paths cross  \citep{fodor78}, as in (\ref{ddg}b).

\ex Who$_j$  can't  you remember which papers$_i$

\z \label{ddg}
\z

\noindent
A similar analysis is offered by \citet[477]{freezing}, who note that  constructions like (\ref{f}c) must cause increased processing effort since the point of retrieval and integration coincides with the point of reanalysis. The existence of a preferential alternative parse that is locally licit but globally illicit  can in turn lead to a  `digging-in' effect \citep{ferreirahend,ferreirahend2,tabor3}, in which the  more committed the parser  becomes to a syntactic parse, the  harder it is to backtrack and reanalyze the  input. The net effect of these factors is that the correct parse of
(\ref{f}c) is less probable and therefore harder to identify than that of  (\ref{f}b), which suffers from none of  these problems, and is  regarded to be more acceptable than
 (\ref{f}c) by \citet[453]{fodor78} and others. See \citet{chavesf} for experimental evidence that speakers
 can adapt and to some extent overcome some of these parsing biases.
 
 Finally, prosodic and pragmatic factors are likely also at  play in (\ref{f}), as in the RRC. \citet{huck} show that when an unstressed stranded preposition  is separated from its selecting head by another phrase, oddness ensues for prosodic reasons.  Finally,  \citet{huck} and  \citet{boling92} also
 argue that freezing effects are also in part due to a pragmatic conflict created by extraposition and extraction: \emph{wh}-movement has extracted a phrase leftward, focusing interest on that expression, while at the same time extraposition has moved a constituent rightward,  focusing interest on that constituent as well.  
Objects tend to be extraposed when they are discourse new, and even more so when they are heavy \citep[71]{wasowbook}. Therefore, the theme phrase \emph{a picture of John} in (\ref{f}c) is strongly biased to be discourse new,  but this clashes with the fact that an entirely different entity, the recipient, is leftward extracted, and therefore is the \emph{de facto} new information that the open proposition is about.  No such mismatch exists in (\ref{f}a) or (\ref{f}b), in contrast, where the extraposed theme is more directly linked to the  entity targeted by leftward extraction.


\section{Subject Islands}

Extraction out of subject phrases like (\ref{classic}) 
is broadly regarded to be impossible in several languages, including
English \cite{Ross67,chomsky73}, an effect referred to as a \emph{Subject Island} (SI).
This constraint is  much less severe  in languages like Japanese , German, and Spanish,
among others \citep{stepanov,jurkaetal,goodall11,greco,fukuda,polinsky13}.

\noindent
However, English exceptions were noticed early on, and have since accumulated in the literature.
In fact,  for \citet{Ross67},  English extractions like (\ref{sie}a) are not illicit,
and more recently \citet[147]{chomsky08} has added more such counterexamples.
Other authors noted that certain extractions from subject phrases are naturally attested, as in (\ref{sie}b,c). Indeed,  \citet{annerels} shows that extractions like those in (\ref{sie}c) are in fact acceptable to native speakers.\footnote{For completeness, other authors argue that PP extractions from
 NP subjects are illicit, such as \citet[653]{lasnikpark}, among many others.}

\z \label{sie}
\z

\noindent
English exceptions to the SI constraint are not restricted to PP extractions, however. Although
\citet{Ross67} claimed NP extractions from NP subjects like (\ref{rosssi}) are illicit,
it was arguably premature to generalize from such a small sample.

To my knowledge, SI violations involving subject NPs are not attested, but those involving
infinitival VP subjects like  (\ref{vpsia}) ar.
See  \citet[471]{chavesextr} for more attestation examples.

Incidentally, Subject phrases are not absolute extraposition islands either, as in (\ref{subxxx}),
which  are significantly  more acceptable than  *\emph{$[$Pictures \spc$]$ frighten people $[$of John$]$}  \citep{drummond}.\footnote{Again, the relative acceptability of such extractions
cannot be due to the presence of a derived subject given the oddness
of examples involving similarly derived subjects  like  *\emph{$[$A photograph of a book \spc$]$ was published last year $[$about French cooking$]$} \citep{akma75}.}

Consider now SI effects involving more complex subject phrases.
Infinitival subject clauses seem to impose no SI constraint, an observation going

 \citep[471]{chavesextr}.

\z \label{vpsi}

\noindent
Infinitival subjects contrast dramatically  finite CP subjects in that the 
latter are renowned for being particularly hard to extract from,  as in  (\ref{ssc}).
  \citet{Ross67} dubbed this extreme kind of SI the  \emph{Sentential Subject Constraint} (SSC). See also  \citet{chomsky73}, \citet{huang82},  \citet{Chomsky86b}, \citet{freidin92}.\footnote{That said, \citet{chavessubj} reports that some native speakers find SSC violations like  (i) to be fairly acceptable, again raising some doubt about the robustness of English SI effects:

There are  few good functional reasons for why CP SI violations are so strong. First, subject CP clauses are notorious for being particularly difficult to process, independent of extraction. For example, it is known that tense can induce greater processing costs
 \citep{kluender92,gibson0000}. Second, CP  subjects  are often  stylistically marked and difficult  to process,   as  (\ref{that}a) illustrates. Thus, it is extremely hard to embed a CP subject within another CP subject, even though such constructions ought to be perfectly grammatical,  like (\ref{that}b,c). 

\ea
\ea That the food that John ordered tasted good pleased him.\\

 \ex \bad{*}That that the world is round is obvious is dubious.\\
\citep{kuno74}
\z \label{that}
\z



 Interestingly, CP subjects become more acceptable if  extraposed as shown in (\ref{exps}).
The explanation offered by  \citet[356--357]{fod74} is that speakers tend to  take the initial clause in the sentence  to be the  main clause. Thus, \emph{that} is taken to be the subject, but the remainder
of the structure does not fit this pattern. Thus, a sentence like (\ref{exps}a) causes
 increased  processing  load  because  it has a  different structure 
than the parser expects.
This processing problem does not arise
in the counterpart in (\ref{exps}b).\footnote{See  \citet{gibson07} for online evidence
that  the word \emph{that} is preferentially interpreted as a determiner even in syntactic contexts where it cannot be a determiner. 
 Gibson's evidence suggests that both top-down (syntactic) expectations are independent from bottom-up (lexical) frequency-based expectations in sentence processing. Thus, 
CP subject phrase  starting with the complementizer
\emph{that} is likely to be misparsed as a matrix clause with sentence-initial  pronominal or determiner \emph{that}.}

\noindent
  Indeed, \citet{fodor67},  \citet{bever}, \citet{frazier88} also
 show that extraposed clausal subject sentences
 like (\ref{ext}a) are easier to process than
their in-situ counterparts like (\ref{ext}b). 
Not surprisingly,  the former are much more frequent than the latter,
which  explains why the parser would expect the former more than the latter.

\noindent
Note that embedded conditionals like (\ref{pinker}a) are also exceedingly 
difficult to parse, although perfectly syntactically well-formed.
However,   such structures can become more acceptable with fewer embeddings to strain
working memory, and with judicious use of prosodic cues that indicate  the relevant structure, as illustrated by  the acceptability of (\ref{pinker}b).
This is  evidence that the oddness of (\ref{pinker}) is
at least in part due to performance.

  If we add a filler-gap dependency to a sentence that already is complex by
  virtue of having  a clausal  subject, the resulting structure
  may be too difficult to parse.  This   point is illustrated by
  the contrast in (\ref{that2}).

\noindent
As argued by \citet{dubinsky2009}, the low acceptability
 of extraction in subject-auxiliary inversion sentences with clausal subjects 
  is more likely to be the result of extragrammatical factors than of grammatical conditions.
For example,  not all extractions like (\ref{v}b) are unacceptable, as
\citet[382--387]{delahunty} and
\citet[115]{dubinsky2009} point out. 

\ea

The evidence discussed so far suggests that  sentences involving extraction and CP subjects  are odd 
is at least in part due to the likely cumulative effect of   various sources of  processing complexity. 
Sentences with sentential subjects are unusual structures, which can 
mislead the parser into the wrong analysis. A  breakdown in comprehension can occur
because the parser must hold complex incomplete phrases in memory
while processing the remainder of the sentence. The presence of a filler-gap dependency
will likely only make the sentence harder to process. 
It is independently known that the  more committed the parser 
becomes to a syntactic parse, the  harder it is to reanalyze the 
string \citep{ferreirahend,ferreirahend2,tabor3}.
This is usually referred to as a ``digging-in'' effect.
For example, unless prosodic or contextual cues  are employed to
boost the activation  of the correct  parse,   (\ref{compz}) will 
be preferentially  misanalysed as having the structure [NP [V [NP]]].

\ea Fat people eat accumulates.
\z \label{compz}

\noindent
The garden-path effect that the digging-in causes in example (\ref{compz}) serves as
 an  analogy for what may be happening in particularly difficult  subject island violations. 
In both cases,  the sentences have exactly one grammatical analysis, but that parse
 is preempted by a highly preferential alternative  which  ultimately cannot yield a 
 complete analysis of the sentence.  Thus, without prosodic cues indicating
 the extraction site, sentences like (\ref{temp}) induce a significant digging-in effect
 as well.

\ex[*]{
Which problem will a solution to be found by you?

\ex[*]{

\zl

This also explains why SI violations like  (\ref{excz}) are relatively acceptable: the  processing cost of an NP-embedded CP  is smaller than the processing cost incurred by processing a CP subject.\footnote{For claims that NP-embedded CP SI violations are illicit see  \citep[42]{lasniksaito},   \citep[796]{colinphillips}, and    \citep[67]{colin_horn}.}  CP subjects are unusual structures, inconsistent with the parser expectations \citep{fod74},  and   the presence of filler-gap dependency in an  NP-embedded CP subject is less likely
to cause  difficulty for the parse to go awry than a  filler-gap dependency in a CP subject.\footnote{\citet{clausen,clausencuny} provide  experimental evidence that  complex subjects cause  a measurable increase in processing load,  with and without extraction. Moreover,  it is known that 
elderly adults  have far more difficulty repeating sentences with complex subjects than sentences with complex objects  \citep{kemper86}. Similar difficulty is  found in timed reading comprehension tasks  \citep{kynette}, and in   disfluencies in non-elderly adults \citep{clarkwasow}. 
Speech initiation times  for sentences with complex subjects are
also known to be longer than for sentences with 
 simple subjects  \citep{ferreirasubj,tsiam},
 and sentences with center-embedding in subjects 
are harder to process than sentences 
with center-embedding in objects \citep{amy,eady}.
Finally,  \citet{garnsey}, \citet{kutasetal}, and \citet{vanpetten}  show
that the processing of open-class words, particularly at
the beginning of sentences, require
greater processing effort than closed-class words.}

\z

This complex array of effects  suggests that the SI constraint is not due to a single factor
\citep{chomsky08,chavessubj,fernandez}, be it grammatical or otherwise.  One possibility is that SIs are partly due to pragmatic and processing constraints, perhaps not too different from those that appear to be active in the island effects discussed so far. As  \citet[495]{kluender06} notes: `Subject Island effects seem to be  weaker when the  \emph{wh}-phrase maintains a pragmatic  association not only with the gap, but also with the main clause predicate,  such that the filler-gap dependency into the subject position is construed as of some relevance to the main assertion of the sentence'. Indeed, many authors \citep{shir-jrn,valin86,kuno87,ken,Dean,goldberg13} have argued that
extraction is in general restricted to the informational focus of the proposition, and that
Subject Islands (among others) are predicted as a consequence. In a nutshell,
since subjects  are typically reserved for topic continuity,  subject-embedded referents are unlikely to be the informational focus of the utterance.  Although it is not easy to construct sentences where a dependent of the subject can be easily deemed as the informational focus, it is by no means impossible. 
For instance,  (\ref{kh}a) is particularly acceptable because whether or not an impeachment causes outrage crucially depends on who is impeached (cf.\ with  \emph{Would the impeachment of Donald Trump cause outrage?}). Similarly, in (\ref{kh}b) whether or not an attempt failed or succeeded crucially depends on what was attempted (cf.\ with \emph{The attempt to find the culprit ended in failure}). 

\ea
\ea Which President would [the  impeachment of \spcs] cause  outrage? \\
\citep{chavesextr}

 \ex What did [the attempt to find \spcs]  end in failure?\\
 \citep[370]{hofsaglang}
 \z \label{kh}
 \z
 
Although some experimental research has confirmed that sentences with extraction from subject phrases are less acceptable than grammatical controls Subject Island effects \citep{sprsat2,goodall11,crawfordwccfl,clausencuny,greco}, and that their acceptability
remains consistently low during repeated exposition  \citep{sprsat2,crawfordwccfl}, other research has found that the acceptability of  Subject Island violations is not consistently low, and can be made to increase significantly \citep{hiramatsu00,clausencuny,chavesjeruen,chavessubjexp}. This mixed evidence is consistent with the idea that SI effects are very sensitive to the particular syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of the utterance in which they occur. If the items are too complex, or stylistically awkward, or presuppose unusual contexts, then it is entirely possible that 
SI effects are extremely strong.  For example, if the extraction is difficult to process because the sentence gives rise to local  garden-path and digging-in effects and is pragmatically infelicitous in the sense that the extracted element is not particularly relevant for the proposition (i.e.\ unlikely to be what the proposition is about) then we obtain a very strong SI effect. Otherwise, the SI effect is weaker, or nearly non-existent as is the case of (\ref{kh}), of (\ref{vpsia}),
and of the  pied-piping examples studied by \citet{annerels}.

This approach also explains why subject-embedded gaps often become more acceptable in the presence of a second non-island gap: since the two gaps are co-indexed, then the fronted referent is trivially relevant for the main assertion, as it is predicated by the main verb. For example, the low acceptability of (\ref{pgbq}a) is arguably caused  by the lack of   plausibility of the described proposition: without further contextual information, it is unclear how the attempt to repair  an unspecified thing $x$ is connected to the attempt causing  damage to a car. 


\ea 
\ea \bad{*}What did [the attempt to repair \spcs] ultimately damage the car?
\ex What did [the attempt to repair \spcs] ultimately damage \spc?\\
\citep{colinphillips}
\z \label{pgbq}
\z

\marginpar{\tiny cite old HPSG work on parasitic gaps}

\noindent
The example in  (\ref{pgbq}a)  becomes more acceptable if it is contextually  established that $x$ is  a component of the car. In contrast, (\ref{pgbq}b) is felicitous even out-of-the-blue because it  conveys a  proposition  that is  readily recognized as being plausible according to world knowledge: attempting to fix $x$ can cause  damage to $x$.  If Subject Island effects are indeed contingent on how relevant the extracted subject-embedded referent is for the assertion expressed by the proposition, then a wide range of acceptable  patterns is to be expected, parasitic or otherwise. This includes cases like  (\ref{symbd}), where both gaps are in Subject Island environments. As \citet{Levine:Sag:03}, \citet[256]{levhubook},  and \citet[161]{Culicover13} note, cases like (\ref{symbd}) should be completely unacceptable, contrary to fact.


\ea
 This is a man who $[$friends of \spcs $]$
 think that $[$enemies of \spcs $]$ are everywhere.
 \z \label{symbd}

The conclusion that Subject Island effects are contingent on the particular proposition expressed by the utterance thus seems unavoidable \citep{chavesresp}. In order to test this hypothesis, \citet{chavesresp} examine the 
the acceptability of sentences like (\ref{pairs}), which crucially  express nearly-identical truth conditions and have equally acceptable declarative counterparts. This way, any source of acceptability contrast must come from the extraction itself, not from the felicitous of the proposition. 

\ea 
\ea Which country does the King of  Spain resemble [the President of \spcs]?
\ex Which country does [the President of \spcs] resemble  the King of Spain?
\z \label{pairs}
\z

\noindent
The results indicate that although the acceptability of the SI counterpart in (\ref{pairs}b)
is initially significantly lower than (\ref{pairs}a), it gradually improves.
After 8 exposures, the acceptability of near-truth-conditionally equivalent sentences like (\ref{pairs}) becomes non-statistically different.\footnote{Crucially, no such amelioration is observed with undisputedly ungrammatical
utterances, such as *\emph{Which complaint does the tenant of the condo rarely hear at each of the caretakers?}}
What this suggests is that SI effects are at least in part probabilistic: the semantic, syntactic and pragmatic
likelihood of a subject-embedded gap likely matters for how acceptable such extractions are. This is 
most consistent with the claim that -- in general -- extracted phrases must correspond to the informational focus
of the utterance  \citep{shir-jrn,valin86,kuno87,ken,Dean,goldberg13}, and in particular with the intuition that
SI violations are weaker when the extracted referent is relevant for the main predication \citep[495]{kluender06}.






\section{Adjunct Islands}

\citet{cattell} first noted that adjunct phrases  often resist extraction, 
as illustrated in  (\ref{tad}), a phenomenon usually referred to 
as \emph{The Adjunct Island Constraint} (AIC). 

\ea
\ea \bad{*}What$_i$ did John die [whistling \spc$_i$]? 
\ex \bad{*}What$_i$ did John build [whistling \spc$_i$]? 
\ex \bad{*}Which club$_i$ did John meet a lot of girls [without going to \spc$_i$]?\\
\citep[38]{cattell}
\ex \bad{*}Who$_i$ did Mary cry [after John hit \spc$_i$]?\\ 
\citep[503]{huang82}
\z  \label{tad}
\z

Although the constraint on {\sc slash} discussed above in (\ref{relcx}) would effectively ban 
all extraction from adjuncts,  the problem is that the AIC has a long history of exceptions, 
noted as early as \citet[38]{cattell}, and by many others since, including 
\citet[72]{chomsky82}, \citet{engdahl}, \citet[103]{hegarty90}, \citet{cinque}, \citet[??]{pollardsag}, 
\citet[253]{culicover87}, and \citet{borg}. A sample of representative counterexamples
is provided in (\ref{catt}).

% Chaves


\ea
\ea Who did he buy a book [for \spc]?
\ex Who would you rather [sing  with \spc]?
\ex What temperature should I wash my jeans [at \spc]?
\ex That's the symphony that Schubert [died without finishing \spc].
\ex Which report did Kim [go to lunch without reading \spc]?
\ex A problem this important, I could never [go home without solving \spcs first].
\ex  What did he [fall asleep  complaining about \spc]?
\ex  What did John [drive Mary crazy trying to fix \spc]?
\ex Who did you [go to Girona in order to meet \spc]?
\ex Who did you go to Harvard [in order to work with \spc]?
\z \label{catt}
\z

 Exceptions to the AIC include  tensed adjuncts, 
as noted by \citet[88]{grosu81}, \citet[29]{deane}, \citet{kluender}, \citep[287]{levhubook},  \citet[144]{gold06},  \citet[471]{chavesextr}, \citet[175, ft.1]{truswellbook} and others. A sample is provided in (\ref{gr}).\footnote{\citet{truswellbook} argues that the AIC and its exceptions are best characterized in terms of event-semantic constraints, such that the adjunct must occupy an event position in the argument structure of the main clause verb. However, such an account incorrectly predicts that extractions from tensed adjuncts is impossible.}

\ea \label{gr}
  \ea These are the pills that Mary died [ before she could take \spc].
   \ex This is the house that Mary died [ before she could sell \spc].
\ex  The person who I would kill myself [if I couldn't marry \spc] is Jane.
\ex Which book  will Kim understand linguistics better [if she reads \spc]?
\ex  This is the watch that I got upset [when I lost \spc].
\ex   Robin, Pat and Terry were the people who I lounged around at home
all day [without realizing were \spcs coming for dinner].
\ex Which email account would you be in trouble [if someone broke into \spc]?
\z 
\z

\noindent 
To be sure, some of these  sentences are complex and difficult to process,  
which in turn can lead speakers to prefer the insertion of an `intrusive' resumptive 
pronoun at the gap site, but they are certainly more acceptable than the 
classic tensed AIC violations examples like Huang's (\ref{tad}d).
Acceptable tensed AIC violations are more frequent in languages like Japanese, Korean,  and Malayalam, which appear to exempt from the AIC altogether (Yoshida 2006). 

Like Subject Islands, AIC violations sometimes improve `parasitically' in the presence of a second gap as in (\ref{parasaic}). First of all, note that these sentences express radically different propositions, and so there is no reason to assume that all of these are equally felicitous.
Second, note that (\ref{parasaic}a,c) describe plausible  states-of-affairs in which it is clear what the extracted referent has to do with the main predication and assertion, simply because of the fact that \emph{document}  is predicated by \emph{read}.  In contrast, (\ref{parasaic}b) describes an unusual state-of-affairs in that is it unclear what the extracted referent  has to do with the main predication \emph{read the email}, out-of-the-blue. Basically, what does reading emails have to do with filing documents?

\ea 
\ea  Which document did John read \spcs before filing \spc? 
\ex \bad{*}Which document did John read the email email before filing \spc?
\ex Which document did John read \spcs before filing a complaint?
\z \label{parasaic}
\z

\noindent
In a context where it is made clear what is the link between the document and reading an email, then (\ref{parasaic}b) is more coherent,  and more acceptable:

\ea 
{\sc Context:} \emph{Kate works at a law office, and has been training John as part of his internship. Kate sent John 10 documents for him to file, as well as 10  emails with the correct filing instructions, as part of a test. John was supposed to first file the documents and only later check the respective email for the correct filing procedure.}

 \,[Kate:]  How did you do? 

 \,[John:]  I cheated only once... it was a very tricky case, I thought. All other
documents were relatively straightforward to file. It took me about two hours to complete the task.

 \,[Kate:]  Which document was it that you read the email before filing? 
\z

In addition, if AIC violations were truly only salvageable parasitically, then counterexamples
like (\ref{books}a) should not exist.  As 
\citet{Levine:Sag:03} and
\citet[256]{levhubook}
note, both gaps reside in island environments and should be 
completely out and less acceptable than (\ref{books}b,c), contrary to fact.

\ea
\ea What kinds of books do [the authors of \spc] argue about royalties [after writing \spc?
\ex \bad{*}What kinds of books do [authors of \spc] argue about royalties after writing malicious pamphlets?
\ex ??What kinds of books do authors of malicious pamphlets argue about royalties
[after writing \spc]?
\z \label{books}
\z

\noindent
In (\ref{books}a), there is no sense in which the gap inside the subject is parasitic on the gap inside the  adjunct, or vice-versa -- under the assumption that neither gaps is supposed to be licit without  the presence of a gap outside an island environment. In conclusion, the notion of parasitic 
gap is rather dubious. See \citet[??]{levhubook} for a more in-depth discussion of parasitism and 
empirical criticism of null resumptive pronoun accounts.

As in the case of other island phenomena discussed so far, it is doubtful  that any purely syntactic account can describe all the empirical facts in a Rather, semantic-pragmatic account  appears to be more promising: extractions out of adjuncts are licit to the degree that the extracted
referent can be interpreted as being relevant for the assertion.

\section{Superiority Effects}

Contrasts like those below have traditionally been taken to be due to a constraint
that prevents a given phrase from being extracted if another phrase in a higher
position can be extracted instead \citep{chomsky73,chomsky80}. Thus, the highest \emph{wh}-phrase
is extractable, but the lowest is not.

\ea
\ea Who \spcs saw what?
\ex \bad{*}What did who see \spc?
\z \label{badsc1}
\z

\ea
\ea Who did you persuade \spcs to buy what?
\ex \bad{*}What did you persuade who to buy \spc?
\z \label{badsc2}
\z

Several different kinds of exceptions to this Superiority Constraint (SC) have been 
noted in the literature. First, it is generally recognized that \emph{which}-phrases are
immune to the SC:

\ea
\ea I wonder which book which of our students read \spc over the summer?
\ex Which book did which professor buy \spc?
\z \label{book}
\z

\noindent
 \citet{pesetskydlink} proposed to explain the lack of SC effects in (\ref{book}) 
by stipulating that  \emph{which}-phrases are interpreted as indefinites and do not undergo LF movement. Rather, they require `D-linking' and obtain wide scope via an entirely different semantic mechanism called unselective binding. In order for a phrase to be D-linked, it must be associated with a salient set of referents. But as \citet[248ff.]{ginzsag} note, there is no independent evidence
for saliency interpretational differences between \emph{which} and other \emph{wh}-phrases like
\emph{what} and \emph{who}. For example, it is implausible that speakers have a specific referent
in mind for the \emph{which}-phrases in examples like (\ref{which}).

\ea
\ea I don't know anything about cars. Do you have any suggestions about which car -- if any -- I should buy when I get a raise?
\ex I don't know anything about cars. Do you have any suggestions about what  -- if anything -- I should buy when I get a raise?\\
\citep[248]{ginzsag}
\z \label{which}
\z



Furthermore, there are acceptable SC violations involving multiple \emph{wh}-questions such as those in (\ref{multiple}). See \citet{Bolinger78}, \citet{kayne83} and \citet[109]{pesetskydlink} for more
such examples and discussion.\footnote{\citet{gibson10} and others have found no evidence
that the presence of a third \emph{wh}-phrase improves the acceptability of a multiple
interrogative, even with supporting contexts. However, the examples in (\ref{multiple}) 
require peculiar intonation phrasings and contours, which may be difficult to elicit with written stimuli.} 

\ea
\ea Who wondered what {\sc who} was doing \spc?
\ex What did {\sc who} take \spcs {\sc where}?
\ex Where did {\sc who} take {\sc what} \spc?
\z \label{multiple}
\z

\noindent 
Finally, there are also SC violations that involve echo questions like (\ref{break1}) and reference
questions like (\ref{break2}). See \citet[Ch.7]{ginzsag} for detailed argumentation that echo questions are not fundamentally different, syntactically or semantically,   from other uses of interrogatives.

\ea
\ea What did Agamemnon break?
\ex What did {\sc who} break \spc?
\z \label{break1}
\z

\ea
\ea What did he break?
\ex What did {\sc who} break \spc?
\z \label{break2}
\z

There are two different, yet mutually consistent, possible explanations for SC effects in HPSG circles.
 One potential factor concerns  processing difficulty \citet{arnon07}. Basically,  long-distance dependencies where a \emph{which}-phrase is fronted are  generally  more acceptable and faster to process than those where \emph{what} or \emph{who} if fronted, presumably  because the latter are semantically less informative, and thus decay from memory faster,  and are compatible  with more potential gap sites before the actual gap.
 The second potential factor is prosodic in nature. Drawing from insights by 
\citet[170--172]{Ladd96} about the
English interrogative intonation, \citet[251]{ginzsag} propose that in a multiple \emph{wh}-interrogative construction all \emph{wh}-phrases must in {\sc focus} except  the first. Crucially, focus is typically -- but not always --  associated with clearly discernible pitch accent. Thus, (\ref{badsc1})  and (\ref{badsc2}) are odd because  the second \emph{wh}-word is unnaccented. In this account, a word like \emph{who} has two possible lexical descriptions, shown in (\ref{whoavm}).


\ea
\ea \emph{Ex-situ} interrogative \emph{who}:

{\small \begin{avm}

\end{avm}}

\z \label{whoavm}
\z

Since only the (optionally accented) lexical entry in (\ref{whoavm}a) is specified with a 
non-empty {\sc wh} value, the theory of  extraction proposed in \citet{ginzsag} predicts 
that (\ref{whoavm}a) must appear \emph{ex situ}.  In contrast, the accented lexical entry in
 (\ref{whoavm}b) is can  appear\emph{in situ}. For more discussion see  \citet[261]{levhubook}.

A related range of island phenomena concern extraction from \emph{whether}-clauses like
which are traditionally assumed to be forbidden as (\ref{whex}) illustrates.

\ea
\ea \bad{*}Which movie did John wonder wether Bill liked?
\ex \bad{*}Which movie did John ask why Mary liked?
\z \label{whex}
\z 

\noindent
But again, the oddness of such data is unlikely to be due to syntactic constraints,
given that examples like (\ref{whexc}) are passable.

\section{The Left Branch Condition}

\citet{Ross67} discovered that the leftmost constituent of an NP cannot be extracted, 
as in  (\ref{lbcv}), a constraint he dubbed as the \emph{Left Branch Condition} (LBC).\footnote{As in other island environments discussed above, the LBC is not operative in constraining semantic scope, as illustrated below.

\ea
Someone took a picture of each student's bicycle.\\
\citep[303]{MRS}
\zlast}
 
 
\ea
\ea  \bad{*}Whose$_i$ did you meet [ \spc$_i$ friend]?\\
 (cf. with `\emph{You met whose friend?}')
 
\ex \bad{*}Which$_i$ did you buy [ \spc$_i$ book]?\\
(cf. with `\emph{You bought which book?}')

\ex \bad{*}How much$_i$ did you find [ \spc$_i$ money]?\\
(cf. with `\emph{You found how much money?}')
\z \label{lbcv}
\z

These facts are accounted for in versions of HPSG where determiner phrases
are not valents of the nominal head. If the DP is not listed in the argument structure
of the nominal head, then there is no way for the DP to appear in {\sc slash}.
Incidentally, for exactly the same reason, adnominal adjectives cannot be extracted either, as they are not selected  by any head, and therefore  are not listed in any {\sc arg-st} list. 
The extraction of PPs is allowed, however, to the extent that these are valents of the nominal head rather than modifiers.\footnote{Note, however, that in order to allow certain adverbials to be extractable,  \citet{ginzsag} assume that they are nonetheless members of {\sc arg-st}. See \citet{levhubook} and  \crossrefchaptert{udc} for more discussion.}
The same goes for complement PP extraposition. For example, the following are analyzed as PP extraposition followed by NP leftward extraction.

\ea
 \ea \,[How many books]$_i$ do you have [ \spc$_i$ about mathematics]?
\ex \,[How many pictures]$_i$ do you have [ \spc$_i$ of Marilyn Monroe]?
\ex \,[How many attempts]$_i$ did you make [ \spc$_i$ to repair the computer?
\z
\z

\noindent
Indeed there are various  languages  which do not permit extraction of left branches from noun phrases, 
but have a particular PP construction which does allows NP extraction with PP stranding:

\ea
\ea \gll dare-kara-no$_i$  Taroo-ga  [\spc$_i$  tegami]-o  sute-ta-no?\\

%\glt `How many math books do you have?' \hfill (Portuguese)
 \z \label{langslbc}
\z


Now,  \citet{Ross67} also  noted that some languages do not obey the LBC at all. A small sample of grammatical LBC violations is shown  in (\ref{lbcx}), which are completely ungrammatical in languages like English. The languages
 in question lack determiners, and therefore it is possible that what is extracted is an argument of the nominal head
that corresponds to a PP in languages like those in (\ref{langslbc}).

\section{The Complementizer Constraint}

\citet{Perlmutter68} noted that subject phrases have different extraction properties than that of object phrases, as illustrated in (\ref{subobjasymm2}). The presence of the complementizer hampers extraction of the subject, but not of the complement.\footnote{There is no evidence that the Fixed Subject Constraint applies at the semantic level, however. The  subject phrase of the embedded CP can outscope the subject phrase of  the matrix:

\eal
\ex Some teacher claimed that each student had cheated.

\noindent
In \citet{bouma} and \citet{ginzsag}, extracted arguments are typed as \type{gap-ss} rather than \type{canon-ss}. Only the latter are allowed to correspond to {\it in situ} signs and to reside in valence lists. However, subject extraction is different. If a subject phrase is extracted, then the list {\sc subj} contains the respective \type{gap-ss} sign. This in effect renders extracted subjects invisible to the rest of the grammar.
In particular, if one assumes that the lexical entry for the complementizer \emph{that} requires 
S complements specified as $[${\sc subj} $\langle \, \rangle]$ then the oddness of 
(\ref{subobjasymm2}) follows.


\section{Island circumvention via Ellipsis}

Ellipsis somehow renders island  constraints inactive, as in (\ref{slc}). A deletion-based analysis of such phenomena such as  \citet{merchantbook}  relies on moving the \emph{wh}-phrase before deletion takes place, but since  movement is assumed to be sensitive to syntactic island constraints, the  prediction is that (\ref{slc}) should be illicit, contrary to fact.

The  account adopted in HPSG is one in which remnants  are assigned an interpretation based on the surrounding discourse context  \citep{ginzsag,Culicover:Jackendoff:05,jacobson08,sagn}. 
See \crossrefchaptert{ellipsis} for more detailed discussion. In a nutshell,  the \emph{wh}-phrases in (\ref{slc}) are `coerced' into a proposition-denoting clause via a unary branching construction that taps into contextual information.  This straightforwardly explains not only why the antecedent for the elided phrase need not correspond to  overt discourse --  e.g. \ sluices like \emph{What floor?} or \emph{What else?} --
but also  why (\ref{slc})  are immune to island constraints: there simply is no island
 environment to begin with, and thus, no extraction to violate it.



\section{Conclusion}

HPSG remains relatively agnostic about many island types given the existence of robust exceptions.
It is however clear that many island effects are not purely due to syntactic constraints, and are more likely
the result of multiple factors, including pragmatics, semantics and processing difficulty.
To be sure, it is yet unclear how these factors can be brought together are articulate an explicit
and testable account of island effects. In particular, it is unclear how to combine probabilistic information with syntactic, semantic and pragmatic representations, although one fruitful avenue of approach to this problem may be via  \emph{Data-Oriented Parsing} REF.  


From its inception, HPSG has been meant to be compatible with models of language comprehension and production \citep{sagser,Sag:Wasow:ta,Sag:Wasow:ta2}, but not much work has been dedicated to bridging these worlds; see \crossrefchaptert{processing}. The challenge that island effects posit to any theory of grammar is central to linguistic theory and cognitive science: how to integrate theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistic models of on-line language processing so that fine-grained predictions about variability in acceptability judgements across nearly isomorphic clauses can be explained.
